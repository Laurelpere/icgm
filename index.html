	<h2>Hindrances To Growth In Grace</h2>
	<p>It is sad but true that only a few Christians actually make a success of growing in grace. Infact, some Christians who have been saved 30 to 40 years seem to have regressed rather than progressed. I believed God wants us to grow.</p>
        <span id="cont0">How can you be a Christian for years, yet you can't read Bible on your own or come to church on your own. You mess up anything committed into your trust. Years in church yet you don't know where church is coming and where it is going. Which person will be happy with a child who cannot help him or her in anyway at five years of age. Your lack of growth as a Christian is affecting the church in which you belong.</span>

	<h2>The Unique Jesus</h2>
	<p>A unique person is a person characterized by peculiar or notable traits, a person who illustrates certain phases of character. In every standard Jesus was never a match to any human being, dead or alive. Those who try to equal Jesus with Mohammed etc, were not just and fair to Jesus.</p>

        <span id="cont1">Jesus alone possessed and displayed the credentials of the promised messiah that was to come into the world. These credentials were the out workings of His perfect moral character. He was the Messiah, and He was in the world, His words, deeds and manner of life authenticated His divine mission and claimants.<strong>(Jn 1:10-12,14 Jn 7:46 Mk 1:22)</strong>. Some ways in which Jesus was unique, are:
     <ol>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Birth(Heb. 1:1-13)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Person(Lk. 1:26-35)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Ministering(Mk. 1:21-28)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Death(Jn. 19:16-30)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Resurrection(Acts 1:1-9)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Ascension(Matt. 16:27)</li>
     	<li>His second coming</li>
     </ol>

     Since no other individuals can be so unique like Jesus, He alone is worthy of all worship. Trusting on anything rather than Jesus is idolatry. The idea that those who worship God through any other individuals or mediums are serving God, are children of God and will also make it to God's kingdom is falsehood, a deception from hell. Anyone who does not receive and acknowledge Jesus as Lord of his/her life will not make it into God's kingdom.

	<h2>Making Kingdom Choices</h2>
	<p>As Christians we are called to do the will of God at all time and seasons. It is God's will for you to practice charitable deeds, pray, fast et cetera, but in doing them, many Christians do them wrongly. Someone said "he doesn't want to do good again because the good he had done in the past didn't favor him", it is not true that the good you did failed, but the way and manner the good is done</p>
        <span>Good deeds with a wrong motive will not attract God's blessings. Whatever good deed you do, don't do it with the wrong intentions, such as: eye service, to earn praises from men. Note, by motive I mean, what is in your heart, when you do the things you do? If you must get blessed for your givings and charitable deeds you must do it right and with the right heart, whatever you do, do it to give God glory.(Gen 4:6-7; 2Kgs. 10:19-31)</span>

	<h2>The Cost Of Trust</h2>
	<p>If there is one factor that has caused a lot of disaffection amongst Christians, it is lack of trust to one another. It is becoming increasingly difficult for Christians to trust themselves due to insecurity in character of most fellow believers.</p>
        <span>Priviledges and freedom are offered as result for ones demonstration of trustworthiness. Since trust is built gradually over time, take every opportunity to prove your reliability even in minor matters. Where can you be counted in this church? If there will be revival we must begin to put Trust in the ability of the Holy Spirit in us and in His word.</span>
