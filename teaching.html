	<h2>Speak Faith-filled Words Over Your Church</h2>
	<p><strong>"Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. - Proverbs 6:2"</strong> <br><br> There is power in the words we speak, as a matter of fact, words are so powerrful that God created the world by them.</p>
        <span>Hebrews 11:3 tells us<strong> "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear"</strong>. We can frame our world of peace, prosperity, and healing by the words that comes out of our mouth. <strong>Proverbs 6:2;</strong> also tells us that we are snared by the words of our mouth. <strong>James 3:6;</strong> tells us that the tongue can ignite a fire and it can spread. This is true negatively and positively, just like gossip spreads in a negative way, you can spread good things about your church in a positive way also.<br><br>

	<h2>The Unique Jesus</h2>
	<p>A unique person is a person characterized by peculiar or notable traits, a person who illustrates certain phases of character. In every standard Jesus was never a match to any human being, dead or alive. Those who try to equal Jesus with Mohammed etc, were not just and fair to Jesus.</p>

        <span>Jesus alone possessed and displayed the credentials of the promised messiah that was to come into the world. These credentials were the out workings of His perfect moral character. He was the Messiah, and He was in the world, His words, deeds and manner of life authenticated His divine mission and claimants.<strong>(Jn 1:10-12,14 Jn 7:46 Mk 1:22)</strong>. Some ways in which Jesus was unique, are:
     <ol>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Birth(Heb. 1:1-13)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Person(Lk. 1:26-35)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Ministering(Mk. 1:21-28)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Death(Jn. 19:16-30)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Resurrection(Acts 1:1-9)</li>
     	<li>Uniqueness in His Ascension(Matt. 16:27)</li>
     	<li>His second coming</li>
     </ol>

     Since no other individuals can be so unique like Jesus, He alone is worthy of all worship. Trusting on anything rather than Jesus is idolatry. The idea that those who worship God through any other individuals or mediums are serving God, are children of God and will also make it to God's kingdom is falsehood, a deception from hell. Anyone who does not receive and acknowledge Jesus as Lord of his/her life will not make it into God's kingdom.

	<h2>Making Kingdom Choices</h2>
	<p>As Christians we are called to do the will of God at all time and seasons. It is God's will for you to practice charitable deeds, pray, fast et cetera, but in doing them, many Christians do them wrongly. Someone said "he doesn't want to do good again because the good he had done in the past didn't favor him", it is not true that the good you did failed, but the way and manner the good is done</p>
        <span>Good deeds with a wrong motive will not attract God's blessings. Whatever good deed you do, don't do it with the wrong intentions, such as: eye service, to earn praises from men. Note, by motive I mean, what is in your heart, when you do the things you do? If you must get blessed for your givings and charitable deeds you must do it right and with the right heart, whatever you do, do it to give God glory. <br><br>

	<h2>The Work Of The Inspired Word</h2>
	<p><strong>"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. - 2 Timothy 3:16."</strong><br><br> Before one can understand the work of the Holy Spirit, he or she must have a thorough understanding of the Spirit's work through the word He inspired to be written for man.</p>
        <span>It must be affirmed that the Spirit's primary work is through the effect of the inspired word of God has on the world. The bible is not just another book, it is God's work through the Holy Spirit to direct mankind unto believing and obeying the will of God. Many Christians have gone as far as excluding the study of the bible because they believe the Holy Spirit teaches us directly what we must believe and say. When either emotions or traditions are exalted above the word of God, then the religious individual is on his way from God. The word of God is the result of the work of the Spirit, it follows, therefore, that the Spirit intends to work through the word which He inspired to be written. We must always trust in the simplicity of the revealed scriptures and their instructions we are to follow in order to please God.<br><br>

	<h2>Surviving Under Pressure And Persecution</h2>
	<p><strong>"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. - Matthew 16:18"</strong><br><br> The statement of Christ in our text above is a prophetic promise that should give all Christians an assurance of survival irrespective of the present or future pressure and persecution.</p>
        <span>While every Christian desires to scale above every mountain of persecution and scale through the wind of pressure that blows against their pathway, many do not comprehend the secrets of surviving. The bible is replete with many saints who survived the fire of persecution and the depressing moments of situational pressures by keeping to the truth of the gospel to the end. In other to survive the pressures and persecutions in this world we must: <ol>
        	<li>Focus on Jesus</li>
        	<li>Be Prayerful</li>
        	<li>Commit ourselves to the word</li>
        	<li>Magnify the grace of God more than the pressure or persecution</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
